# Gameboy Emulator

## Introduction
This is a prototype gameboy emulator in a very early stage. Progress is slow/nonexistent. 
Built for education first and performance second. 
As such accuracy or emulationg every part of the console is of no concern currently.

## Code Conventions
- any hex ciphers that use letters (i.e. 0xFF, 0xA8) must use the capitalized letter
- code files relating to emulating the gameboy should be placed under /emu
- files that contain data that is not code or this readme should be placed in /data
- lines that are not necessarily easily understood may be explained on the same line. keep it as short as possible
